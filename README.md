# Terraform Infrastructure Management

This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing cloud infrastructure across various providers. The goal is to demonstrate best practices in infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform.

## Project Overview

This project showcases modular Terraform configurations that allow users to provision, manage, and destroy cloud resources efficiently. The repository includes examples for setting up different types of resources and best practices for organizing Terraform code.

## File Structure

The repository contains the following directories and files:

- **`modules/`**: Contains reusable Terraform modules for different cloud resources.
- **`environments/`**: Contains environment-specific configurations.
  - **`dev/`**: Development environment configurations.
  - **`prod/`**: Production environment configurations.
- **`provider.tf`**: Configures the provider(s) for Terraform.
- **`variables.tf`**: Defines the variables used across configurations.
- **`terraform.tfvars`**: Provides variable values for different environments.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your machine.
- An active account with the cloud provider you wish to use (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Cloud CLI installed for authentication (optional but recommended).

### Configuration

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanidhya-Vats/Terraform.git
   cd Terraform
   ```

2. **Customize the variables**:
   Open `terraform.tfvars` and modify the variables according to your requirements.

### Deploying Infrastructure

1. **Navigate to the desired environment**:
   ```bash
   cd environments/dev
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan the deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted.

### Cleaning Up

To remove the resources created by Terraform, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
